# DotnetNative

DotnetNative was created to create a comfortable library infrastructure for creating native .dlls in C# and to set some standards and rules.

### Established rules:
1. Use only **x64** build.
2. Do **not** use **Debug** build for release.
3. Do not use personal libraries. Only from DotnetLibrary projects
